# Electric_vehicle-_sales_-trends
Analyzed global electric vehicle sales and battery trends using SQL and Power BI. Built an interactive dashboard to show market growth, top countries, and forecasts till 2030.
🚗🔋 Electric Vehicles Market Analysis Dashboard
#Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive Electric Vehicles (EV) Market Analysis using Power BI and SQL to derive actionable insights into global EV adoption trends, battery improvements, and sales forecasts. The aim is to understand the growth trajectory of EVs and their impact on sustainability goals.
Objective

    To analyze historical and forecasted sales data of electric vehicles globally.

    To identify top countries and regions leading EV adoption.

    To explore battery capacity trends and their impact on EV range and market acceptance.

    To develop an interactive Power BI dashboard for clear and dynamic storytelling.

Tools & Technologies Used

    Power BI: For dashboard creation, visual storytelling, and interactivity.

    SQL: For data cleaning, aggregation, and transformations before dashboard modeling.

    Excel: For initial data exploration, validation, and quick summary statistics.

📈 CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate)

CAGR measures the average annual growth rate of EV sales over a period longer than one year. It smooths out the growth rate to show what the yearly growth would have been if it had grown at a steady rate.

Formula:
CAGR=(Last Year EV SalesFirst Year EV Sales)1Number of Years−1
CAGR=(First Year EV SalesLast Year EV Sales​)Number of Years1​−1

🔄 Penetration Rate Change from 2022 to 2024

    Absolute Change
    This calculates the straightforward difference in penetration rate between 2024 and 2022, expressed in percentage points.

    Formula:
    Absolute Change=Penetration Rate2024−Penetration Rate2022
    Absolute Change=Penetration Rate2024​−Penetration Rate2022​

    Relative Change
    This shows how much the penetration rate has changed relative to its value in 2022, giving an idea of the growth rate compared to the initial value.

    Formula:
    Relative Change=(Penetration Rate2024−Penetration Rate2022Penetration Rate2022)×100
    Relative Change=(Penetration Rate2022​Penetration Rate2024​−Penetration Rate2022​​)×100
